# Machine Learning Project for Trading Company

## Business Requirements

The client is a trading company aiming to gain a competitive edge by identifying patterns in Bitcoin price movements to make informed trading decisions.

**Objective:**

1. Identify key variables that correlate with significant Bitcoin price changes.
2. Predict if Bitcoin's price will rise or fall in the near term and determine the likely trend strength. 

## Hypothesis and How to Validate

1. Hypothesis: Bitcoin price changes correlate with trading volume (in BTC and USD).

- Validation: A Correlation study can help in this investigation
   
2. Hypothesis: Daily closing prices are influenced by the daily high and low prices.

- Validation: A Correlation study can help in this investigation

## The Rationale to Map the Business Requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML Tasks
1. **Business Requirement 1:** Data Visualization and Correlation study:
   - Will inspect the data related to the closing price.
   - Will conduct a correlation study (Pearson and Spearman) to understand better how the variables are correlated to the closing price.
   - Will plot the main variables against the closing price to visualize insights.
   
2. **Business Requirement 2:** Classification, Regression:
   - We want to predict the closing price of the new day. Will build a regression model.
   - We want to predict if it is a good momnet o buy or to sell. We want to build a classification model for buy and sell signals.

## ML Business Case for Each Model

### Predict Next Closing Price
- **Model Type**: Regression
- **Goal**: Predict the next closing price based on historical data.
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - RÂ² score of at least 0.7.
- **Failure Conditions**: 
  - More than 30% of predictions being off by 20% after 6 months.

### Predict Buy/Sell Signals
- **Model Type**: Classification
- **Goal**: Predict whether the market trend is favorable for a "buy" or "sell" decision.
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - 80% recall for buy/sell signals.
- **Failure Conditions**: 
  - More than 30% incorrect buy/sell predictions after 3 months.

## Client Benefits
- Data-driven insights for better trading decisions.
- Real-time predictions for increased market responsiveness.
- Enhanced profitability by accurate forecasting of prices and trends.

- Checkbox: Data inspection on Bitcoin metrics (display the number of rows and columns in the data, and display the first ten rows of the data).
- Checkbox: Individual plots for closing prices against high/low prices.
- Checkbox: Visualize the overlay plot for trading volume and price changes.

### Page 3: Bitcoin Price Prediction and Buy/Sell Signal
- Addresses Business Requirement No. 2: Price Forecasting, providing a brief overview of the prediction methods used while running predictions on live data.

### Page 4: Project Hypothesis and Validation
- Before the analysis, we aimed to outline each project hypothesis, the conclusions drawn, and the validation methods employed. After data analysis, we can report the following:
    - **Hypothesis 1:** Daily closing prices are influenced by the daily high and low prices.
        - This is supported by correlation analysis showing significant relationships between closing prices and daily high/low prices.
    - **Hypothesis 2:** The calculated trade value and MACD will enhance the accuracy of predicting potential price rises or falls in the near term.
        - This hypothesis is validated by the findings from our correlation study and predictive models.
