# Machine Learning Project for Trading Company

## Business Requirements

The client is a trading company aiming to gain a competitive edge by identifying patterns in Bitcoin price movements to make informed trading decisions.

**Objective:**

1. Identify key variables that correlate with significant Bitcoin price changes.
2. Predict if Bitcoin's price will rise or fall in the near term and determine the likely trend strength. 

1. **Business Requirement 1:** Data Visualization and Correlation study:
   - Will inspect the data related to the closing price.
   - Will conduct a correlation study (Pearson and Spearman) to understand better how the variables are correlated to the closing price.
   - Will plot the main variables against the closing price to visualize insights.
   
2. **Business Requirement 2:** Classification, Regression:
   - We want to predict the closing price of the new day. Will build a regression model.
   - We want to predict if it is a good momnet o buy or to sell. We want to build a classification model for buy and sell signals.

- Checkbox: Data inspection on Bitcoin metrics (display the number of rows and columns in the data, and display the first ten rows of the data).
- Checkbox: Individual plots for closing prices against high/low prices.
- Checkbox: Visualize the overlay plot for trading volume and price changes.

### Page 3: Bitcoin Price Prediction and Buy/Sell Signal
- Addresses Business Requirement No. 2: Price Forecasting, providing a brief overview of the prediction methods used while running predictions on live data.

### Page 4: Project Hypothesis and Validation
Before the analysis, we aimed to outline each project hypothesis, the conclusions drawn, and the validation methods employed. After conducting the data analysis, we can report the following:

- Hypothesis 1: Bitcoin price changes correlate with trading volume in USD.

This relationship is supported by our correlation study, indicating a significant link between price movements and trading volume in USD.

- Hypothesis 2: Daily closing prices of Bitcoin are influenced by the daily high and low prices, impacting the trend direction and strength.

This hypothesis is validated by correlation analysis, suggesting that further exploration of these variables is warranted.

## Fixed Bugs

* The initial regression model struggled to make accurate predictions on live data. To address this, I developed Version 2 of the regression model, which involved a thorough review of the feature set. During this process, I eliminated the simple moving averages as they appeared redundant. Moreover, the 100-day and 50-day SMAs required a substantial amount of historical data to produce their first data points.

* After retraining Version 2 of the model, I observed improved results, although they were still not optimal. To further enhance performance, I accessed the dataset directly from the Binance API, which I refer to as 'live data.' This dataset includes approximately one year of additional historical data, providing more context. I retrained the model using this API data by fitting it with the transformed features, excluding the 'close' column for predictions. Then, I used the retrained model to predict the closing price for the most recent day, achieving satisfactory results. This approach significantly improved the model's predictive capability.
