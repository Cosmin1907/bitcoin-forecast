# Machine Learning Project for Trading Company

## Business Requirements

The client is a trading company aiming to gain a competitive edge by identifying patterns in Bitcoin price movements to make informed trading decisions.

**Objective:**

1. Identify key variables that correlate with significant Bitcoin price changes.
2. Predict if Bitcoin's price will rise or fall in the near term and determine the likely trend strength. 

[Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Hypothesis and How to Validate

1. Hypothesis: Bitcoin price changes correlate with trading volume (in BTC and USD).

- Validation: A Correlation study can help in this investigation
   
2. Hypothesis: Daily closing prices are influenced by the daily high and low prices.

- Validation: A Correlation study can help in this investigation

## The Rationale to Map the Business Requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML Tasks
1. **Business Requirement 1:** Data Visualization and Correlation study:
   - Will inspect the data related to the closing price.
   - Will conduct a correlation study (Pearson and Spearman) to understand better how the variables are correlated to the closing price.
   - Will plot the main variables against the closing price to visualize insights.
   
2. **Business Requirement 2:** Classification, Regression:
   - We want to predict the closing price of the new day. Will build a regression model.
   - We want to predict if it is a good momnet o buy or to sell. We want to build a classification model for buy and sell signals.

## ML Business Case for Each Model

### Predict Next Closing Price
- **Model Type**: Regression
- **Goal**: Predict the next closing price based on historical data.
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - RÂ² score of at least 0.7.
- **Failure Conditions**: 
  - More than 30% of predictions being off by 20% after 6 months.

### Predict Buy/Sell Signals
- **Model Type**: Classification
- **Goal**: Predict whether the market trend is favorable for a "buy" or "sell" decision.
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - 80% recall for buy/sell signals.
- **Failure Conditions**: 
  - More than 30% incorrect buy/sell predictions after 3 months.

## Client Benefits
- Data-driven insights for better trading decisions.
- Real-time predictions for increased market responsiveness.
- Enhanced profitability by accurate forecasting of prices and trends.

- Checkbox: Data inspection on Bitcoin metrics (display the number of rows and columns in the data, and display the first ten rows of the data).
- Checkbox: Individual plots for closing prices against high/low prices.
- Checkbox: Visualize the overlay plot for trading volume and price changes.

### Page 3: Bitcoin Price Prediction and Buy/Sell Signal
- Addresses Business Requirement No. 2: Price Forecasting, providing a brief overview of the prediction methods used while running predictions on live data.

### Page 4: Project Hypothesis and Validation
- Before the analysis, we aimed to outline each project hypothesis, the conclusions drawn, and the validation methods employed. After data analysis, we can report the following:
    - **Hypothesis 1:** Daily closing prices are influenced by the daily high and low prices.
        - This is supported by correlation analysis showing significant relationships between closing prices and daily high/low prices.
    - **Hypothesis 2:** The calculated trade value and MACD will enhance the accuracy of predicting potential price rises or falls in the near term.
        - This hypothesis is validated by the findings from our correlation study and predictive models.

## Fixed Bugs

* The initial regression model struggled to make accurate predictions on live data. To address this, I developed Version 2 of the regression model, which involved a thorough review of the feature set. During this process, I eliminated the simple moving averages as they appeared redundant. Moreover, the 100-day and 50-day SMAs required a substantial amount of historical data to produce their first data points.

* After retraining Version 2 of the model, I observed improved results, although they were still not optimal. To further enhance performance, I accessed the dataset directly from the Binance API, which I refer to as 'live data.' This dataset includes approximately one year of additional historical data, providing more context. I retrained the model using this API data by fitting it with the transformed features, excluding the 'close' column for predictions. Then, I used the retrained model to predict the closing price for the most recent day, achieving satisfactory results. This approach significantly improved the model's predictive capability.

## Deployment to Heroku

* The App live link is: https://bitcoin-forecast-21da6c961a62.herokuapp.com/
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
